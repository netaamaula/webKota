                Long ago, a king and queen had a baby daughter named Rapunzel.
                What her devoted parents didn’t know was that Rapunzel’s golden 
                hair contained magical healing powers. A selfish old woman named 
                Mother Gothel knew of the magic in Rapunzel’s hair and wanted it 
                to keep herself young. So she kidnapped the baby and raised her 
                in a tower deep in the woods, never telling her that she was a 
                princess.

                As Rapunzel’s hair grew and grew, she loved gazing out the tower 
                window at the lights that floated in the night sky every year on 
                her birthday. She longed to leave the tower and see them up close, 
                but Mother Gothel refused. Meanwhile, a young thief named Flynn 
                Rider had stolen something special from the King’s castle, and the 
                royal guards were after him. Suddenly, he saw the perfect hiding 
                place—a tower! When Flynn Rider climbed into the tower, Rapunzel 
                knocked him out with a frying pan. Then she secretly inspected the 
                satchel he carried. Inside, Rapunzel found a sparkling gold object. 
                It was so familiar.

                Flynn Rider awoke and found himself tied to a chair with Rapunzel's 
                long, golden hair. Rapunzel pointed to her painting of the floating 
                lights. Tomorrow was her eighteenth birthday. If Flynn took her to 
                see the lights, she’d return his satchel.After Flynn agreed to help, 
                Rapunzel used her hair to climb down from the tower. She'd never 
                been outside before! But when her feet touched the grass, Rapunzel 
                nearly burst with excitement, exclaiming, “Woo-hoo!”
